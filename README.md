# BreastCancerPrediction


#

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the model being trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to measure its accuracy in predicting breast cancer. The model can be optimized by adjusting various parameters such as the type of algorithm used, the number of features used for training, and the threshold for classifying a patient as having breast cancer or not.

The final output of the project is a breast cancer prediction model that can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer based on the input features. Such models can be helpful for healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely diagnoses, which can ultimately lead to better treatment outcomes for patients
